    "## Description:\n",
    "Diabete has become widespread in the United States ans worldwide. In 2016, 9.5% of adults aged 18 years and older had diabetes. In 2016, diabetes was the direct cause of 1.8 million deaths and in 2017 high blood glucose was the cause of another 2.6 million deaths. Early diagnosis of diabete significantly reduces the global health care cost and substantialy improves patients' living conditions. Glucose level, insulin fluctuation, mass mass index, pregnancy, age, blood pressure and skin thickness are all valuable implications that have potential to reflect patients diabetic conditions. Thus, correctly prediecting the status of diabetic patient can prolong patients' lives, reduce medical costs via early preparation of treatments, diet and physical exercises. Therefore, this project will build a supervised learning model that predicts diabete from historical pima female data and information. Specificly, the objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage."
